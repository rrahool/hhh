			e-Commerce site. (B) Rent a house beside the business to use as residence of investors or workers and 
			eventually the residence will be owned as part of a real estate business. (C) Process the visa for investor’s, 
			Skilled Workers and Students.</p>
			<br>
			<p style="text-align:justify">The main concepts of this model are, that the Investor’s will have a established 
			business with a living place beside the business location as well as the students having a part time job 
			while completing their studies. Hopefully they will become a business owner after their study. As this model 
			is very much related to investor’s and students, the HHH will find the business near the universities around 
			the country (USA).</p>
			<br>
			<p style="text-align:justify">In the near future, a significant number of students can be involved or 
			established the technology business after their study where skilled workers will be required. Those technology 
			businesses can perform the projects virtually, offshore and onshore as well.</p>
			<br>
			<p style="text-align:justify">Some technology projects can be done by virtually or offshore but onshore 
			projects need to invite the skilled workers and thus HHH can help to process skilled workers visa.</p>
